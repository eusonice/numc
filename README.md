### Provide answers to the following questions.
- How many hours did you spend on the following tasks?
  - Task 1 (Matrix functions in C): 3 hours
  - Task 2 (Speeding up matrix operations): 20 hours
- Was this project interesting? What was the most interesting aspect about it?
  - <b>This project was really interesting. Good review of writing code in C and understand SIMD and MIMD using Intel Intrinsics (AVX2) and OpenMP.</b>
- What did you learn?
  - <b>I learned how to optimize code to improve performance of running the code. Some skills I obtained through this project are implementing SIMD instructions, parallelizing the code, searching for more efficient algorithms for efficiency such as repeated squaring, using loop unrolling, cache blocking, etc.</b>
- Is there anything you would change?
  - <b>I think the debugging part was hard. I solved the problem by writing some test cases on various sizes of input matrices for each functions.</b>
